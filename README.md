This website is a data visualization and analysis project built using publicly available NYPD Stop & Frisk data from the NYCLU (New York Civil Liberties Union). Originally developed for my Web Design course (DiDA 280W), the project aims to highlight disparities in policing patterns and provide deeper insight through interactive charts, maps, and data summaries.

All data analysis and development were completed independently by me, Jake Mecca.
